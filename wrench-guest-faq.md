Hey, happy you've agreed to do an interview for `wrench`!
I'll describe the process here and answer common questions.

## Overview

`wrench` is a collection of stories about professionals trying to escape
the 9-to-5 to do something they believe in.

We document these attempts including financial info, details of projects
they have been working on, emotional and lifestyle changes.

We publish in a form of a blog and a podcast.

## FAQ

### What will we use for the call?

- Google Meet: [link](https://meet.google.com/pqo-jnoz-nbu)
- If you'd like to use skype or something else, please [write Andrey](mailto:andrey@flpvsk.com) in advance.

### How long will it take?

Around 1 hour.

### What's required for the recording from my side?

- Headphones, so your microphone doesn't capture the voice of the
  interviewer
- If we'll end up using Skype, "Automatically adjust microphone settings"
  in `Preferences -> Audio/Video` should be **unchecked**
- A quiet room

### What are the good-to-haves?

- An external microphone
- An ability to record **your voice** while we talk e.g. QuickTime on Mac
  can do that.  Iâ€™ll record myself and you over Skype. Skype introduces
  delay and quality might be poor. If you record yourself, the audio
  quality of your track will be much better.

### Will I get the draft of the episode / blog post before it's released?

Yes.

Looking forward to talking with you!
